    <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/" target="_blank">Mathworks' MATLAB <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
    is available for use in the DesignSafe Discovery Workspace but requires a license
    before you can use the application. MATLAB is supported under a "bring your own license"
    model.
</p>
<p>
    In order to run MATLAB at DesignSafe using "bring your own license", you need:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>a MATLAB floating network license; and</li>
    <li>
        a MATLAB license server that allows remote access from computational resources
        used by DesignSafe.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you are unsure about the above details, please CC your MATLAB license administrator
    on the request.
