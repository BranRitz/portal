General description of site: 
-ca. 1927 steel through-truss bridge running roughly east-west over Arkansas River
-5 span steel through truss, with multi-span simply-supported steel girder approach on west end and one span pony truss on east end approach
-Also known locally as the “Belford bridge” 

GPS Coordinates: (George to fill in)

Observations:

West abutment:
-Gap between abutment and soil
-Spalling of cover concrete (approx. 1 sq. ft.) on top of abutments (indication of pounding with bridge deck), cracks in superstructure adjacent to abutment pounding site
-Some spalling of concrete on bottom side of deck adjacent to the abutment (it was difficult to tell how much of this spalling was from the earthquake. Some of it looked recent, at least since the last time the steel girders were coated with metallic paint; however, some of the exposed rebar was rusted)
-The anchor bolts in the steel girder bearing plates had fractured; however, these appeared to have been severely corroded and may have fractured before the earthquake.
-Long crack in the soil parallel to the slop on the south side of the road just beside the bridge
-Dense wooded terrain around the abutment

East abutment:
-Gap between abutment and soil
-Crack in soil parallel to the abutment, approximately 4 ft. from the abutment and 20 ft. long
-Minor cracking in concrete (unclear if due to earthquake)
-Southern-most steel rocker bearing appeared to have some permanent displacement in the form of prying uplift, which appeared to be recent due to the clean and less worn concrete surface that was exposed beneath; however, it is unclear if this was caused by the earthquake.
-Dense, tall grass vegetation along river bank.
 
Deck:
-Recent spalling of some cover concrete and cracking in the concrete curb at the expansion joints
