    <h1>Disconnect Dropbox.com</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        By disconnecting your Dropbox.com account from DesignSafe, you will no longer be able
        to browse files from Dropbox.com on DesignSafe. This <strong>will not</strong>
        delete any files from either DesignSafe or Dropbox.com. What <strong>will</strong> happen
        is that you will be removing the authorization you granted DesignSafe to manage files
        and folders in your Dropbox.com account.
    </p>
    <p class="alert alert-info">
        To reiterate, this will not delete any files. If you wish to delete the files from either
        your Dropbox.com storage or your DesignSafe storage you will need to do that manually.
    </p>
    <p class="alert alert-warning">
        You will still see DesignSafe on your Dropbox.com Account Security page. Be assured that
        by disconnecting your account here DesignSafe will no longer be able to act on your
        Dropbox.com account. If you wish, click "Forget App" on the Dropbox.com Account Security page
        to ensure access has been revoked.
