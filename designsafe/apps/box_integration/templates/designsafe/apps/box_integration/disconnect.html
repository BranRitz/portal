    <h1>Disconnect Box.com</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        By disconnecting your Box.com account from DesignSafe, you will halt any automatic
        syncing of files and folders between Box.com and DesignSafe. This <strong>will not</strong>
        delete any files from either DesignSafe or Box.com. What <strong>will</strong> happen
        is that you will be removing the authorization you granted DesignSafe to manage files
        and folders in your Box.com account.
    </p>
    <p class="alert alert-info">
        To reiterate, this will not delete any files. If you wish to delete the files from either
        your Box.com storage or your DesignSafe storage you will need to do that manually.
    </p>
    <p class="alert alert-warning">
        You will still see DesignSafe on your Box.com Account Security page. Be assured that
        by disconnecting your account here DesignSafe will no longer be able to act on your
        Box.com account. If you wish, click "Forget App" on the Box.com Account Security page
        to ensure access has been revoked.
