    <h1>Disconnect Box.com</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        By disconnecting your Box.com account from DesignSafe-CI, you will halt any automatic
        syncing of files and folders between Box.com and DesignSafe-CI. This <strong>will not</strong>
        delete any files from either DesignSafe-CI or Box.com. What <strong>will</strong> happen
        is that you will be removing the authorization you granted DesignSafe-CI to manage files
        and folders in your Box.com account.
    </p>
    <p class="alert alert-info">
        To reiterate, this will not delete any files. If you wish to delete the files from either
        your Box.com storage or your DesignSafe-CI storage you will need to do that manually.
    </p>
    <p class="alert alert-warning">
        You will still see DesignSafe-CI on your Box.com Account Security page. Be assured that
        by disconnecting your account here DesignSafe-CI will no longer be able to act on your
        Box.com account. If you wish, click "Forget App" on the Box.com Account Security page
        to ensure access has been revoked.
